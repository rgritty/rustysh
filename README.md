# rustysh

A minimal Unix shell written in Rust. Built as part of my transition into
low-level systems programming and Rust development.

### Features
- Basic REPL loop
- Runs external commands
- Graceful exit and error handling

### Roadmap
- Command pipelines (`|`)
- Built-in commands (e.g., `cd`)
- Background execution (`&`)
- Command history

### Why?
I'm exploring systems programming and compiler infrastructure using Rust. This
the first step in my journey.
